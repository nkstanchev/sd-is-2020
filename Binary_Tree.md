# Binary Tree

![Binary tree image](/assets/images/Binary_tree.svg.png)

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child

## Applications
- Binary trees  are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting.

- As a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating structure. Common examples occur with Huffman coding and cladograms. The everyday division of documents into chapters, sections, paragraphs, and so on is an analogous example with n-ary rather than binary trees.
